pCloud is your personal cloud space where you can store all your files and folders. It has a user-friendly interface that clearly shows where everything is located and what it does. The software is available for almost any devices and platforms – iOS and Android devices, MacOSX, Windows OS, and all Linux distributions. By installing pCloud on your computer (through its desktop application pCloud Drive), the app creates a secure virtual drive which expands your local storage space. Every change you make in your pCloud can be seen immediately on your computer, phone or tablet. All your devices are instantly synchronized and you have direct file access to any update you make.
